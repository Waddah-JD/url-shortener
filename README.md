powered by: Node, Express, Redis, React, Redux and Docker

instructions: `docker-compose up --build` -> visit `http://localhost:3333/`

Backlog:
- make sure that ids are unique
- show all available urls on load
- build a `production` version and use it in docker-compose instead of built `development` version
- cover reducers with tests
- make it visually ok(ish)
