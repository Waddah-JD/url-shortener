# url-shortner
insert a long url, and receive a shorter one.
<br><br><br>
powered by: Node, Express, Redis, React, Redux and Docker
<br><br><br>
instructions: `docker-compose up --build` -> visit `http://localhost:3333/` for the UI
<br>
as for the API endpoint, it's (separately?) accessible at: `http://localhost:42666/`
<br><br><br>
Backlog:
- make sure that ids are unique
- show all available urls on load
- build a `production` version and use it in docker-compose instead of built `development` version
- cover reducers with tests
- make it visually ok(ish)
