powered by: Node, Express, Redis, React, Redux and Docker

instructions: `docker-compose up --build` -> visit `http://localhost:3333/` for the UI
<br>
as for the API endpoint, it's "separately" accessible at: `http://localhost:42666/`

Backlog:
- build a `production` version and use it in docker-compose instead of built `development` version
- cover reducers with tests
- make it visually ok(ish)
